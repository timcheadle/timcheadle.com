      <p>I work with a lot of startups, and most of them these days aim to be a &#8220;lean startup&#8221;. The only problem is that folks always seem to misunderstand what a lean startup is or how to apply the techniques. Ultimately, a lean startup is no different from any other business. You need to find a balance between sales, marketing, bookkeeping, customer development and building your product. The right balance depends on your product, your personality and your staff.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re spending all of your time building your product, you&#8217;re likely ignoring what your customers have to say. You&#8217;re probably building exactly what they don&#8217;t need, resulting wasted effort and missed revenue.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re spending all of your time talking to your customers, it&#8217;s likely not providing a very clear focus for what you need to build and deliver. Are you sure you&#8217;re asking the right questions? Running a lean startup doesn&#8217;t mean letting the customers make your decisions for you. It means building something they value and want to pay you to use. As the old Henry Ford quote goes, &#8220;If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>I achieve a balance by acting like a scientist. I treat my business and my clients&#8217; businesses as a set of scientific experiments. Don&#8217;t just test things randomly and see what happens; use the following process:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Build a Hypothesis</strong><br />Come up with an idea about what product customers want and would pay you to have.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Design the Experiment</strong><br />Build the product and focus on launching it, not perfecting it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Run the Experiment</strong><br />Launch quickly. Put the product in front of customers as soon as possible.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Observe the Results</strong><br />Collect customer feedback and watch their use of the product. You&#8217;ll integrate this data into the next round.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Rinse and repeat. Every time you repeat this process, you will have a more refined idea of what your customers expect, and an idea of what they might like but haven&#8217;t asked for.</p>

<p>Notice that I&#8217;m not spending all of my time in any one of these steps. In reality, they&#8217;re all happening in parallel. Also, in a successful business this process never actually ends. So long as you have customers, you have improvements to make.</p>
