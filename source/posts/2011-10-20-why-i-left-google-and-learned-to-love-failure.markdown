title: Why I Left Google and Learned to Love Failure
tags:
---
I was invited to give a talk at the first annual [PajamaConf](http://www.pajamaconf.com)
this weekend and it was a blast. I spoke about my story of going to
work for Google, having the time of my life, but realizing I wanted
more and moving on. My goal was not to enlighten the audience about
my life story, but rather to impart some wisdom I learned along the way.

I plan on writing more about this in the coming weeks, but for now
here’s the short slide desk I prepared. Apparently people like it; it’s
gone from 66 to 43,000+ views in about 24 hours on SlideShare.
Enjoy!
