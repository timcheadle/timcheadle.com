About two years ago, I made the transition from working at a large
corporate campus to working for myself, from home. To say I suffered
culture shock is an understatement. During my entire corporate career,
"working from home" meant waking up really late, catching up on episodes
of Arrested Development, and taking a two hour lunch. Oh yeah, I checked
email every once in a while. It was essentially a day off without
burning any vacation time, and it was part of office culture.

Now that I own my own business, that behavior had to change. I was
solely responsible for putting food on the table which meant I had to
make my business work. I didn't have someone I reported to that would
berate me if the job wasn't done; I was my own boss. The problem was
that I had no idea how to be my own boss. Sure, I knew how to get my job
done and how to make clients happy. What I lacked was the skill of
making sure working from home involved actually working.

I tried setting up a dedicated office, removing clutter from my desk,
only spending time in that room when I was "at work". None of this was
very effective. No problem; I figured I'd solve that by trying my hand
at coworking. Surely being around other productive people would kick me
into gear, right? Wrong. It only made me even more conscious of not
being as productive as I wanted to be, nothing to actually improve it.

However, all of this changed when I started doing one thing: I made my
bed.

Right after I stumble out of bed, I pull up the sheets and make sure my
bed is tidy. I don't spend a lot of time on it and I certainly don't make
[hospital corners](http://artofmanliness.com/2009/11/19/how-to-make-a-bed-you-can-bounce-a-quarter-off-of/).
Being perfect is not the goal. In fact, making my
bed is just a means of accomplishing something more important, a easy
habit resulting in a small victory.

It's a way for me to start my day by immediately being productive.
Instead of lazing around for 30 minutes checking email and Twitter, I
get out of bed, accomplish a task, and get my mind and body ready for
work. Making my bed is a task that I don't have to think about, I have
to do every day, doesn't require much effort and makes me feel good.

To be your own boss and be effective, you need to learn to be productive
without external forces. You need to set your own goals and regulate
your own behavior to accomplish them. What I needed was a simple system,
a dependable, repeatable way of putting me in "work mode". What I lacked
was a routine, and for me making my bed is a really easy way of getting
that back.
