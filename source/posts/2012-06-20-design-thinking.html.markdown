A few weeks ago, I gave a talk at [ATLOSCon](http://www.atlantaobjectivists.com/atloscon-2012)
with my friend and fellow designer, [Tori Press](http://www.redqueenstudio.com/). The conference was
loosely focused on philosophy and individual values, so we wanted to
give people a brief overview of what design is, what it isn't, and how
it relates to living your life. Here's the abstract we originally
proposed to the confererence:

> Design is not art. Design is not engineering. Design is not making
pretty things. Good design is not done based on whims or feelings.
Instead, design is a rational process, a mixture of many disciplines,
drawing on artistic creativity, engineering process and precision, and
philosophy, in order to solve human problems. Once you understand how to
think about design and what it means to produce "good design", you begin
to see so many more realms in your life in which the design process is
applicable. Whether it's uncluttering and decorating your house,
building a system to manage your personal finances, or simply making a
newsletter for your business, you are practicing design. This talk will
focus on overarching principles of good design that you can use in your
everyday life to make this process tangible and fun.

I had a blast giving this talk with Tori and designing the slides.
Enjoy!
