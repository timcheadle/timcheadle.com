While cleaning my office I found some notes I took from this
[Kenya Hara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Hara) talk at
Google from a few years ago. Hara is the art director of
[Muji](http://www.muji.us/) and designed the Olympic ceremonies
in Japan in 1998. I thought I'd share my notes for posterity.

- Emptiness is the possibility and potential of being filled.
- It is because emptiness is vacant that it is open to the opportunity of
possibility.
- Understanding is passed on not by preservation, but by duplication,
gaining new understanding in the process.
- Through constant renewal you determine what is eternal.

You can watch the talk here in its entirety:
