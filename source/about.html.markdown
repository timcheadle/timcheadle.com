## About Me

Hi! My name is Tim; nice to meet you.

I'm a web software engineer, designer, problem solver and entrepreneur.
Generally speaking, I just love making things. Originally from Virginia,
I now live in Charlotte, North Carolina with my beautiful family. Prior
to moving, I spent five years working as an engineering manager at
Google in San Francisco.

In 2011 I founded a web engineering consultancy called [Rational Means](http://rationalmeans.com),
where I help companies use technology to grow and improve their
business. In practice, this means building primarily Ruby on Rails apps,
front end development, product management, and UI/UX design.

I love helping other engineers and designers build sustainable,
interesting businesses. To that end, I founded and continue to organize
[Charlotte Hackers & Founders](http://clthackers.com), a group for local
technology creatives to share ideas and resources. I also serve as an
advisor for several startups and accelerator programs.

Outside of work, I'm a huge coffee geek, love being outside, and I'm a
proud father of a pretty great toddler . I used to be an electronic
music DJ, and now I'm teaching myself how to draw and illustrate.

Iâ€™m [@timcheadle](https://twitter.com/timcheadle) on Twitter, and I'd
love to hear your ideas.
