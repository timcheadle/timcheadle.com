## About Me

Design geek, software engineer and problem solver. After five years at
Google, I left San Francisco for Charlotte, NC to explore my own ideas,
build a business and learn to be a parent. Currently doing freelance
front end development and design while advising startups, meeting people
and enjoying life.

My design blog: [http://fourspace.com](http://fourspace.com)

Iâ€™m [@timcheadle](https://twitter.com/timcheadle) on Twitter.

I also organize [Charlotte Hackers & Founders](http://clthackers.com), a meetup group for local
entrepreneurs and engineers to share ideas and resources.
